home.text=Nowadays, in contrast to many EU countries, there is not a machine readable standard for Greek legislation and therefore we can not arise advanced online legal services. Our goal is to contribute in the representation of legal knowledge and integrating this data into open data in Greece, both from a technological standpoint and in terms of transparency. This paper presents the Nomothesi@, a platform that aims to provide access to Greek law, using technologies of  <a target="_blank" href ="http://semanticweb.org/">Semantic Web</a> and their interface with other datasets (Kallikratis etc.) in the framework of the promotion of e-government. Nomothesi@ adopts OWL ontology <a target="_blank" href="http://www.metalex.eu/">CEN Metalex</a>, while working on an extension of representation of Greek legislation with any quirks presents. The main purpose is the representation of legislative relations and events in terms of content and time (temporal). Alongside the utmost importance is the linked data, which relates both to interface with other public datasets<a target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedopendata.gr/">(Greek Linked Open Data)</a>, and to promote the interconnection with Community law in the promotion of <a target="_blank" href="http://europa.eu/legislation_summaries/justice_freedom_security/judicial_cooperation_in_civil_matters/jl0068_en.htm">ELI (European Legislation Identifier)</a>. On these principles, we are building a Web Application Programming Interface (API) that aims both the publication and presentation of the Greek legislation on public ranges through this handy modern web application, and the possibility the use of open data provided by Nomothesia@ as REST services (XML export - RDF - PDF) to develop applications of special interest (legal, financial, rights) of others.
